# Lip Sync Model Implementation 🎥💬

Welcome to the **Lip Sync Model Implementation** project! 🎉  
This project demonstrates the power of AI in creating highly accurate lip-synced videos. Using cutting-edge open-source models and innovative technologies, we take an image and a generated text-to-speech (TTS) audio, and create a video where the image’s mouth moves in sync with the audio.

---

## 🔍 **Objective**
The goal of this project is to implement a lip sync model that matches the movements of the lips in a static image with the audio derived from a provided script. 

### 📋 **Assignment Details:**
1. **Select an Open-Source Lip Sync Model**: For this project, we have used **LatentSync** (an open-source model with remarkable lip-syncing performance).
2. **Input Data**:
   - **Image**: The provided image or any image of your choice.
   - **Script**: A well-crafted script that will be used to generate the audio.
3. **Output**: 
   - A **lip-synced video** where the image’s mouth movements match the words in the audio.

## 🛠️ **Model & Setup**
In this implementation, we use **LatentSync** (GitHub: [LatentSync](https://github.com/bytedance/LatentSync)), which is a high-performance deep learning-based lip sync model.

### 📌 **Key Features**:
- **High-quality lip-syncing**: Synchronize an image with any generated audio.
- **Indian Accent TTS**: We generate the audio using a Text-to-Speech tool with an Indian accent.
- **Google Colab**: Entire setup and implementation is done on **Google Colab**, so there are no local setups required.

## 🏃 **Steps to Complete the Project**
Follow these steps to generate your lip-synced video:

### **1. Prepare the Environment:**
   - Run the "Prepare Environment" cell to install all necessary dependencies (done directly in **Google Colab**).
   
### **2. Run Image-to-Video Conversion:**
   - Run the "RUN IMAGE TO VIDEO" cell. This will initialize the lip-sync model and get it ready to process your inputs.

### **3. Upload Image:**
   - Upload an image (you can use the one provided or any other image) to be used for lip-syncing.

### **4. Upload Generated Audio:**
   - Upload the audio file generated from your **Text-to-Speech** (TTS) service, with the provided script in the **Indian accent**.
   
### **5. Run Inference:**
   - Run the inference cell, and the model will generate the lip-synced video where the image’s mouth moves according to the audio.

## 💡 **Steps Taken to Generate the Video:**

1. **Chosen Model**: **LatentSync** was chosen for its ability to generate high-quality lip-synced videos.  
2. **Setup in Google Colab**: The entire project runs in **Google Colab** without requiring any local installations or downloads. The setup is automated through a single cell.
3. **Image Used**: The image provided (or one of your choice) was uploaded for lip-syncing.
4. **TTS Audio**: Audio was generated using **Speechma** ([Speechma.com](https://speechma.com/)) in an **Indian accent**.
5. **Inference**: Everything was processed on Colab to produce the final lip-synced video.

## ⚙️ **Code Structure**

The project is structured in the following manner:

- **`Prepare Environment`**: This cell installs all necessary libraries and dependencies.
- **`RUN IMAGE TO VIDEO`**: This cell runs the core of the model that synchronizes the image with the audio.
- **`Script`**: Predefined script for the **Text-to-Speech** tool ensuring that the synchronization is accurate.
  
All the work is done on **Google Colab** and no complex local setup is required. The entire implementation is contained in easy-to-run cells.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Code**

To generate your own lip-synced video, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Environment**:  
   Run the **"Prepare Environment"** cell in **Google Colab** to install all necessary dependencies.

2. **Run Image-to-Video Conversion**:  
   Run the **"RUN IMAGE TO VIDEO"** cell to set up the model for syncing the image and audio.

3. **Upload Image**:  
   Upload an image of your choice or use the provided one for the lip-syncing task.

4. **Upload Generated Audio**:  
   Upload the audio file generated from your **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** tool, ensuring it follows the provided script and is in an **Indian accent**.

5. **Run Inference**:  
   Run the inference cell, and the model will generate a lip-synced video!

## 📹 **Final Output**

The output will be a **video** where the image’s mouth movements are perfectly synchronized with the generated audio. This video can be saved, shared, or further used for analysis.
